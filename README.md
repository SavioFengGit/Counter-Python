# Counter
Counter in Python with GUI.
# Introduction
I needed to use a counter to complete a task, without using an external app on my phone. So I made this simple counter with three functions: increment, decrement and reset.

## Advice 
 - to run the application .exe with a double click use the module pyinstaller
 - run the command: 
    - pyinstaller name_app.py --noconsole --onefile **(let you run your application with a double click, and not through the terminal, really usefull)**
